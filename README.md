# Project Summary
This project allows user to keep track of all their wines, making it easy to find the perfect bottle for the perfect occasion. It also tracks the total value of the user's wine collection and gives them the option of sorting through their bottles by multiple parameters if they want to find their oldest bottle, their most expensive, or various other options. Moving, deleting, and creating wineracks and bottles is easy and intuitive. Support for mobile devices and large screens.

# Challenges
One of the main challenges with this project was learning how to take advantage of the power of Next.js. With Client-Side rendering, the user experience is seamless so the changes that a user makes are instantly updated. Enabling the user to create, delete, and edit bottles/wineracks without reloading the page was a goal I had at the start of the project that I am very glad I acoomplished, as it makes the user experience so much better. Figuring out how to display the racks with bottles in the correct and make them responsive was also challenging, but a great learning experience. 

Overall, this was a great learning project and I am excited to move on to even more challenging projects with the knowledge I have gained.
